# Dorkanizer

Dorkanizer is a Command-line tool that automatically organizes your **Downloads** folder by categorizing files on the basis of their extensions.

```
go get -u github.com/pratyaksh52/dorkanizer
```

## Usage

The program uses a JSON file [`extensions.json`](./extensions.json) which contains a template of categories and their extensions, you can edit them to your liking and create new categories of your choice. Changes made to this file would reflect in the program provided both the files are in the same directory.

The program would use a pre-defined template if the JSON file is not available. The pre-defined template is the same as the default values in the JSON file. [`predefined.txt`](./predefined.txt) is a text file containing the template (modifying this text file won't change the pre-defined template).
