# Downloads Folder Organiser
Automatically organises your cluttered Downloads folder by creating folders of different categories and moving all the files in their respective category.

Creates a `history.txt` file on the Downloads folder which contains names of the files existing on the folder before running the script. 

### Pre-requisites
You must have python installed on your machine.

## Usage
1. Simply run [`organiser.py`](./organiser.py) in the terminal/command prompt.
2. The script uses a JSON file [`extensions.json`](./extensions.json) to create categories and their extensions, you can edit them to your liking and create new categories of your choice.
